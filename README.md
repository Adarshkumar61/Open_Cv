Real-Time Computer Vision Projects using OpenCV


A collection of real-time computer vision projects built using OpenCV and Python, focused on practical implementation, modular design, and future integration with robotics and AI systems.
This repository demonstrates real-time computer vision pipelines using OpenCV. 
The focus is on understanding how image processing algorithms behave in real-world scenarios such as live camera feeds, lighting variations, and performance constraints.

The projects are structured so they can later be extended to robotics, automation, and AI-based perception systems.
• Face Detection using Haar Cascade classifiers  
• Edge Detection using Canny algorithm  
• Basic image processing operations such as grayscale conversion, resizing, and blurring  

Each project is implemented as an independent module for clarity and reusability.
• Python  
• OpenCV  
• NumPy  
• Webcam / Image Input

1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/Adarshkumar61/Open_Cv.git  

2. Navigate to the project directory  
   cd Open_Cv  

3. Install dependencies  
   pip install opencv-python numpy  

4. Run a project  
   python face_detection.py  
Screenshots and demo outputs of face detection and edge detection are available in the demo folder.

These outputs validate real-time performance and algorithm behavior under different conditions.
• Deep learning based object detection (YOLO, CNNs)  
• ESP32-CAM integration  
• ROS2 vision node implementation  
• Autonomous robot perception system
