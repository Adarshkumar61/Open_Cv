## 📊 Results & Observations

- Face Detection works reliably in normal and bright lighting
- Color Detection performs best with fixed color thresholds
- Edge Detection identifies object contours cleanly
- Realtime operations handle frame streams at ~20 FPS

### Notes
- Performance drops in low light
- Future improvement: integrate YOLO for deep learning-based detection
